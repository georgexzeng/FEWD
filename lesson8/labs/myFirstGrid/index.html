                <h2>960 Grid</h2>
                <p>The 12-column grid is divided into portions that are 60 pixels wide. The 16-column grid consists of 40 pixel increments. Each column has 10 pixels of margin on the left and right, which create 20 pixel wide gutters between columns.</p>

                <p>The premise of the system is ideally suited to rapid prototyping, but it would work equally well when integrated into a production environment. There are printable sketch sheets, design layouts, and a CSS file that have identical measurements.</p>

                <p>The 960 Grid System allows you to reposition elements independently by pushing or pulling them horizontally along the page. This is accomplished by using the push and pull CSS classes. For instance, in the example below, imagine the website’s name is typed out in a logo and placed as the first element on the page. As the most important element on the page, you’d like to keep the logo as the first item in your HTML markup, but visually, you actually want it to appear in the center of the page.</p>      
            </div><!-- END .grid_4 -->
